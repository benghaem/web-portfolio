web-portfolio
=============

The complete code for my personal web portfolio. 

The files located on GitHub comprise the entire portfolio minus the raw project files. Raw project files can be viewed from the live site. 

The portfolio is written in HTML, CSS, Ruby, and Javascript and complied by the static-site-generator Middleman. My Ruby Gemfile and Middleman configuration for the project are also included.
