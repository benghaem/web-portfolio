Today was really cold. No, let's rephrase that. Today was way too cold. So after stepping out of the house, waiting for my Jeep to warm up, and really wishing that I had remembered gloves, I was able to drive away to the lovely sounds of HAIM. If you have not heard the HAIM album _Days Are Gone (2013)_ you should go give it a listen. 

_Days Are Gone_ is an interesting mix of alternative rock and what I might call "country-esque." Beginning with the catchy "FallingREADMORE," continuing with the heavy hitting "My Song 5," and ending with the sentimental  "Running If You Call My Name," The album holds its own across its fantastic 11 tracks. The album is thankfully just that, an album. Too often artists release albums that may have a few great singles, but fail to develop an theme over the course of a release. Days Are Gone is the opposite of that, a complete album that is both complex and enjoyable to listen to. 

"Let Me Go" is one of the songs on the album that really stands out. I love the way that the song builds from humming and slowly layers on vocals and percussion, and then finally breaks into a strong beat. It also incorporates my favorite percussive instrument, the wood block, because really, the wood block rocks.

In conclusion, you should buy HAIM's _Days Are Gone_ or at least give it a listen.

And now for something completely different:

CES (The Consumer Electronics Show) is going on right now and I always enjoy watching new tech roll in. This year TV manufacturers are showing off their new bendable OLED displays. Now I have a question: who really needs a tv that can bend? I understand that it presents a nice way to showcase your flexible display tech, but really? A bent display? These tvs are far too large to be used as wrap around displays for something like Eyefinity and I can count the use cases for bent displays one hand. 

What really caught my eye in terms of displays was the ASUS PB287Q. This display offers a 4K display, that's 3,840 x 2,160, for a reported price of $799. Finally, a 4K display that I can pretend I have the disposable income to purchase. But in all seriousness this price-point is awesome because it puts 4K at a equal price point with IPS 1440p monitors (via [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/products/asus/pb287q/) ).

Well that was pretty much my cold morning. Don't freeze to death out there.
