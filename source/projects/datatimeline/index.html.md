This project was a speedy rehash of my earlier dynamic timeline project, but using the HMTL data- attribute to store information about each of the dates. I went into this project with large ideas, but slowly ran into problems as my time dwindled. The project itself is relatively simpleâ€”feed system dates and allow it to place elements on the page. The main issue was that I should have used a database instead of data- elements.

The visual style was a step up from my previous timeline project, and the hover interaction was much more fun as I was not required to display any information about the dates, only an image and a caption. 

If I were to redesign the project, I would transition to an SQL database and foregone the client side positioning.
