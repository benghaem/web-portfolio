This portfolio was initially created for one of my close friends. It features a PHP based gallery that gathers images from a gallery subdirectory and generates thumbnails. The main page loads the subpages via ajax and functions as a similar page using the "#" after the url to determine the correct page to load and ensuring that back-button functionality is not broken

Overall, I was happy with the final result of the project. It remains slightly unfinished--without a contact page, but otherwise is fully functional and with the addition of content could work for a photographer who is only interested in gallery functionality in a portfolio

Another fun aspect of the project was the concentrated amount of time I worked on it. Over the course of about two days, I translated the initial sketches of design and idea into a working page. Sprint style projects like this teach me about how I work under-pressure and how the style and accuracy of my code changes as I work later and later into the night.
