Ever wanted a social-link popup for your website or blog, but didn't want to take the time to create your own? This project generates javascript-free social menus that work across current browsers and include a nice CSS animation. The tool allows users to select icons from 28 different services and arrange them as they wish before generating simple html and css outputs that can then be added to any page.
