This single page portfolio design has one defining feature: the navigation. I designed a fixed position navigation element that follows the user throughout the page and also displays their current position. The idea was to give the user a fun way to navigate the single page while making navigation mirror other common sites. Initially, the navigation uses only pictorial representations of the given anchors, but if the user hovers, the element expands and displays the word. 

After finishing the navigation, I had little else to work on. The remainder of the page styling was inconsistent, and while I attempted to make use of CSS3 properties, I may have gone slightly overboard with the use of border radius. All in all, the project was fun for the navigation and the other aspects of the site received significantly less attention. 

I learned that I need to have a design goal in mind before I begin a project. This project failed because I had an idea for a navigation element and did not know how to build a site around that interaction. It was fun for the user, but the rest of the site was bland and boring.
