I originally created this project as an assignment for my "Global Christianity" class in 10th grade, and it was one of the largest projects I had worked on at the time. I learned a large amount about Javascript, as well as how to manage my time and make comprehensive plans of what I wanted a final project to be able to do. 

When I began the project I had some Javascript experience, but it was a struggle at first to absorb all of the information I needed. This was also the first time that I learned the joys of documentation and close reading of examples. I discovered Stack Overflow, scribbled notes during class, and eventually produced a product I was very, very proud of.

Looking back on the project now is interesting, and I see some areas where I really needed to improve, but I am also happy with the overall product. I think that in many ways this project represents a huge time of my development. I realized that if I put in the time, I could be good at this. The project sparked my interest, and I went from there. I also have to give some credit to my teacher, Mr Yoder. He encouraged me to continue with the project and showed genuine excitement about it as I developed it. I could not have asked for a better teacher/mentor in such a fundamental period of my personal development.
