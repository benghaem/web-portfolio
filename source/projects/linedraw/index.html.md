For a short time, dynamic backgrounds seemed like the coolest thing ever. This project was designed to do exactly that. Like a heartbeat or other rhythm, the line would move slowly across the screen and change colors while generating a unique design every time. The final project has some of that functionality, but was left in a state where debug modes are available. 

The project was interesting because I wanted to have a seamless transition between smoothed and straight lines (The straight lines are the actually generated points). The final solution used two stacked canvas elements that can be toggled with Javascript. First points are generated by taking a random value and mutiplying by the previous point location. This point is then checked to ensure that it is within the bounds of the canvas, and then the point is drawn. To create the curved line, the midpoints of the generated lines are also taken and these points are used to draw a quadratic curve through the points using the 
<pre><code class="language-javascript"> quadraticCurveTo(lastCord[0], lastCord[1], midCord[0], midCord[1])</code></pre>
canvas function. The generated line is both continuous and very smooth resulting in a visually appealing final line.
