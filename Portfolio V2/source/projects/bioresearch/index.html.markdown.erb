Under the advisement of Dr. Louise Temple of James Madison University, Dr. Julia Halterman of Eastern Mennonite University, Dr. Tracey Deem of Bridgewater College, and Mr. Myron Blosser of Eastern Mennonite School, my research partner and I are investigating the gene expression of mice after chronic oral exposure to the herbicide Atrazine at three weeks and at six weeks using microarrays and qPCR. We are using microarrays to determine the affected genes and then targeting them, across all extracted tissue samples, for analysis with qPCR.
