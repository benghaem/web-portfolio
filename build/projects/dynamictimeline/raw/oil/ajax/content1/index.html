<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This timeline shows the 10 largest oil spills that have ever occurred arranged by size. I am excluding intentional oil spills such as the Kuwait Oil Fires because they were intentional and therefore much larger then the accidental ones. Oil spill size measurements will be in barrels of oil(42 US gallons).</p>

<h1>Deepwater Horizon(2010 BP oil spill)</h1>
<p>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was the largest accidental oil spill; spilling 4.9 million barrels in total into the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill was caused by an methane explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig. A bubble of methane had broken through a seal in the well and continued up to the top of the drilling pipe where it exploded and through a chain reaction destroyed the well.

<h1>Ixtoc I</h1>
<p>The Ixtoc I was an oil well that was being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico that suffered a blowout on June 3rd 1979 and spilled 3 million barrels of oil. A blowout is when there is an uncontrolled release of oil into the well that breaks the well by overloading it with pressure after the pressure regulator fails. The spill occurred in shallow water and the fire on the oil rig prevented cleanup teams from reaching it.</p>

<h1>Atlantic Empress</h1>
<p>The Atlantic Empress oil spill was caused when two VLCCs (very large crude carriers) collided 10 miles of Tobago in the Caribbean. The spill occurred on the 19th of July 1979 and spilled an estimated 2.105 million barrels of oil. However, because of the location of the spill and the fact that the Empress sank afterwards litte to no oil reached the surrounding shoreline.</p>

<h1>Fergana Valley</h1>
<p>The Fergana Valley oil spill was a large oil spill that started in Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan on March 2nd, 1992. This oil spill was also caused by a blowout in one of the wells and the well spilled 2 million barrels of oil onto the the surrounding area.</p>

<h1>Nowruz Field Platform</h1>
<p>The Nowruz Field Platform spill started on February 10, 1983 when a tanker collided with a platform in Nowruz Oil Field in the Persian Gulf. The well was in the middle of an active war zone and was not capped until a few months later. However, durring this time another well in the field was attacked and that well was not capped until two years later. By itself the second oil well spilled around 733,000 barrels of oil and The estimated total impact of the event was 1.9 million barrels of oil spilled into the Persian Gulf. </p>

<h1>ABT Summer</h1>
<p>The ABT Summer an oil tanker in transit from Iran to the Netherlands exploded on the 28th of March, 1991. 5 of the 32 crew members died because of the incident and the ship sank spilling around 1.9 million barrels of oil. Because the boat was 900 miles from land the environmental impact was negligible on shore and the wreckage was never found.</p>

<h1>Castillo de Bellver</h1>
<p>The Castillo de Bellver caught fire 70 miles from the coast of Cape Town, South Africa. The ship still on fire drifted away from the coast and sank with the help of explosive charges. The fire took place on August 6th, 1983 and the boat is estimated to have spilled about 1.8 million barrels of oil. </p>

<h1>Amoco Cadiz</h1>
<p>After the Amoco Cadiz's steering failed on the 16th of March 1978 the ship ran aground off the coast of Brittany, France. The ship then proceeded to spill its entire cargo of 1.6 million barrels of light crude into the water. The spill decimated sea life in the area and at the time it was the largest loss of marine life ever recorded as result of an oil spill. Almost 20,000 sea birds died and an estimated 9,000 tons of sea mollusks were destroyed. The oil that washed ashore embedded itself into the coast line and the area was polluted for many years.</p>

<h1>MT Haven</h1>
<p>The MT Haven was a sister ship to the Amoco Cadiz and it also suffered a similar fate. While undergoing cargo balancing operations on April 11th, 1991 a fire started along with an explosion that destroyed part of the hull of the ship. The ship spilled 1.05 million barrels into the Mediterranean Sea. The Haven was then towed and sank into the sea off the coast of Genoa. The spill caused the Mediterranean coast to be polluted for the next decade and destroyed sea life in the area.</p>

<h1>Odyssey</h1>
<p>The Odyssey was a Liberian tanker that broke into two durring rough weather 700 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia and subsequently sank. The event occurred on November the 10th 1988 and spilled 968,000 barrels of oil into the surrounding water. </p>

<h1>Environmental Impact</h1>
<p>While not all oil spills have extreme environmental impacts such as the Amoco Cadiz or the Haven any and all oil spills are dangerous to the environment. Oil spills have insured loss of marine life and destroy ecosystems. For example, birds trapped in oil spills will get covered in oil that can prevent them from flying or reduce their ability to swim. In all cases oil spills are very bad both environmentally and politically.
